Adinoyi Marvyn Omeiza  24/13725 Software Engineering  SEN 201 – SOFTWARE ENGINEERING PROJECT Project Title: Student Management System 1. Introduction Software Engineering is a systematic approach to the development of software systems. This project titled “Student Management System” is designed to manage basic student records using Python programming language. The project follows the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) to ensure proper planning, development, testing, and maintenance of the system. 2. Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) 2.1 Requirement Analysis At this stage, the requirements of the system were identified. The system should be able to: Add new student records View all student records Search for a student using ID Delete a student record Exit the system 2.2 System Design The system is designed using a menu-driven approach. Each operation is implemented using Python functions. A dictionary data structure is used to store student records, where the student ID is the key and the student name is the value. 2.3 Implementation The system is implemented using Python programming language. Functions are created for each operation such as adding, viewing, searching, and deleting student records. The program runs continuously until the user chooses to exit. 2.4 Testing The system was tested using different input values to ensure that: Student records are added correctly Searching returns the correct result Deleting a record works properly Invalid options are handled 2.5 Maintenance The system can be improved in the future by: Adding database support Implementing a graphical user interface (GUI) Adding authentication features 3. Python Program Implementation Copy code Python students = {}  def add_student():     sid = input("Enter Student ID: ")     name = input("Enter Student Name: ")     students[sid] = name     print("Student added successfully")  def view_students():     if not students:         print("No student records found")     else:         for sid, name in students.items():             print(sid, ":", name)  def search_student():     sid = input("Enter Student ID to search: ")     if sid in students:         print("Student Name:", students[sid])     else:         print("Student not found")  def delete_student():     sid = input("Enter Student ID to delete: ")     if sid in students:         del students[sid]         print("Student deleted successfully")     else:         print("Student not found")  while True:     print("\n1. Add Student")     print("2. View Students")     print("3. Search Student")     print("4. Delete Student")     print("5. Exit")      choice = input("Choose an option: ")      if choice == "1":         add_student()     elif choice == "2":         view_students()     elif choice == "3":         search_student()     elif choice == "4":         delete_student()     elif choice == "5":         print("Exiting program...")         break     else:         print("Invalid choice") 4. Conclusion This project demonstrates the application of Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) in developing a simple Student Management System using Python. The project shows how proper planning, design, implementation, and testing lead to a functional and reliable software system
